Algorithm questions for python interview questions

Certainly! Here are some basic Python algorithm-related interview questions that can help you prepare for technical interviews:

1. **Reverse a String:**
   Write a function to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "hello," the output should be "olleh."

2. **Check Palindrome:**
   Write a function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, "racecar" is a palindrome.

3. **Factorial Calculation:**
   Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer. The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence:**
   Write a function to generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. In this sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

5. **Find Maximum Element:**
   Write a function to find the maximum element in an array of integers.

6. **Find Missing Number:**
   Given an array containing numbers from 1 to `n` with one number missing, find the missing number.

7. **Remove Duplicates:**
   Write a function to remove duplicates from an array of integers, maintaining the order of appearance.

8. **Anagram Check:**
   Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order).

9. **Count Words in a Sentence:**
   Write a function to count the number of words in a given sentence.

10. **Binary Search:**
    Implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a specific element in a sorted array.

11. **Bubble Sort:**
    Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

12. **Merge Sort:**
    Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

13. **Linked List Reversal:**
    Write a function to reverse a singly linked list.

14. **Stack Implementation:**
    Implement a stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.

15. **Queue Implementation:**
    Implement a queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.

These questions cover a range of algorithmic concepts and problem-solving skills. Remember that understanding the concepts behind these questions is as important as knowing the answers. Practice coding and reasoning through these problems to build your problem-solving skills.
